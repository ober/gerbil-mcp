    "description": "A tool that statically analyzes .scm FFI files to find c-lambda declarations that dereference pointer arguments (___arg1->field) without null checks. Reports each accessor that could segfault on NULL input, cross-referenced with call sites in .ss wrapper files to check whether the wrapper guards the call with a null/truthy check. This catches the common pattern where FFI accessors blindly dereference pointers that can legitimately be NULL (e.g. xmlNode-children, xmlNode-ns, xmlNode-content returning NULL).",

Manual cross-referencing took multiple tool calls to Read both files and trace each call path.

Reports cases where method dispatch will fail at runtime because the struct/class doesn't have the method defined (either directly or inherited). This catches the common bug pattern where code assumes an interface method exists (like `{close conn}`) but the struct's type hierarchy doesn't define it, leading to silent failures or contract violations at runtime.",
