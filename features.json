    "description": "During planning for a chat application GUI, we discovered ~14 missing Qt functions in gerbil-qt that are essential for real-world apps: scrollToBottom (QTextBrowser/QTextEdit), QTextBrowser::append for incremental HTML, QListWidget item data roles (store IDs alongside display text), setMinimumWidth/Height/setMaximumWidth/Height for size constraints, QLabel::setWordWrap, setCursor for hand cursor on clickable elements, and QTextEdit::toHtml. A gerbil-mcp tool could automatically compare Qt's commonly-used API surface against gerbil-qt's exports and report coverage gaps organized by app type (chat, editor, dashboard, etc.).",

    "example_scenario": "Planning a Webex chat client required checking ~20 individual Qt functions across qt.ss, qt_shim.h, and libqt.ss using grep. Took multiple tool calls to verify each function's availability. A single 'qt gap audit' tool call could have reported all missing functions at once.",
