    "description": "A tool that takes a gerbil-aws client expression (e.g., AWSClient or AWSJsonClient creation code) and validates that the namespace configuration will produce correct key names in parsed responses. It would check if the service's known namespace URI is mapped, and warn if strip-ns would produce incorrect results. Could also test a live API call and show the actual response keys vs expected keys.",

    "description": "A tool that takes a Gambit-mangled symbol name from GDB or a core dump (e.g., `___H_aws_2d_billing____cost_2d_explorer`) and decodes it back to the readable Gerbil module path and function name (e.g., `aws-billing/cost-explorer` module init). Gambit's name mangling encodes hyphens as `_2d_`, underscores as `_5f_`, and uses `____` as module path separators. This tool would parse these conventions and present the human-readable form, helping debug crashes and core dumps.",
