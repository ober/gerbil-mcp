## Gerbil MCP Tools — MANDATORY Usage

When a Gerbil MCP server is available, you MUST use its tools extensively instead of guessing about Gerbil APIs, syntax, or behavior. Gerbil is a niche Scheme dialect with limited training data — always verify with live tools rather than relying on memory.

### Before Writing Code

- **`gerbil_module_exports`**: Check what a module actually exports before using it. Never guess function names.
- **`gerbil_function_signature`**: Check procedure arities before calling functions. Prevents wrong-number-of-arguments errors.
- **`gerbil_check_syntax`**: Validate syntax of any code you write before presenting it.
- **`gerbil_compile_check`**: Run the full compiler (`gxc -S`) to catch unbound identifiers and type issues beyond syntax.
- **`gerbil_doc`**: Look up any symbol for type, arity, qualified name, and related symbols.

### When Exploring or Debugging

- **`gerbil_eval`**: Test expressions interactively to verify assumptions and reproduce issues.
- **`gerbil_apropos`**: Search for symbols by substring when you're unsure of exact names.
- **`gerbil_list_std_modules`**: Discover available standard library modules, optionally filtered by prefix.
- **`gerbil_find_definition`**: Locate where a symbol is defined (source file, module, kind, arity).
- **`gerbil_load_file`**: Parse a `.ss` file to extract its imports, exports, and definitions without executing it.
- **`gerbil_module_deps`**: See what a module imports. Use `transitive: true` for full dependency tree.

### When Understanding Macros

- **`gerbil_expand_macro`**: See the fully expanded core form of a macro expression.
- **`gerbil_trace_macro`**: Step-by-step expansion showing each transformation level.

### When Working with Types and FFI

- **`gerbil_class_info`**: Inspect defclass/defstruct types — slots, fields, inheritance, precedence list.
- **`gerbil_ffi_inspect`**: Classify a module's FFI exports (C constants, C functions, Gerbil wrappers).
- **`gerbil_error_hierarchy`**: View the full exception/error class hierarchy tree.

### For Multi-Step Exploration

- **`gerbil_repl_session`**: Maintain persistent state across evaluations. Define functions, import modules, test incrementally.

### For Building and Testing

- **`gerbil_build_project`**: Compile or clean a project directory using gxpkg.
- **`gerbil_run_tests`**: Execute `:std/test` files and see pass/fail results with failure details.
- **`gerbil_package_info`**: List installed packages, search the package directory, or view metadata.
- **`gerbil_package_manage`**: Install, update, or uninstall Gerbil packages.
- **`gerbil_scaffold`**: Create a new Gerbil project from a template using gxpkg new.

### For Code Quality

- **`gerbil_format`**: Pretty-print Gerbil expressions using Gambit's pretty-print.
- **`gerbil_benchmark`**: Measure wall-clock time, CPU time, GC stats, and memory allocation.

### For Navigation and Discovery

- **`gerbil_find_callers`**: Find all files in a directory that reference a given symbol, with line numbers.
- **`gerbil_suggest_imports`**: Discover which standard library module exports a given symbol.
- **`gerbil_version`**: Check Gerbil/Gambit versions, installation path, and system type.

### Key Principle

**Never guess — always verify.** If you are unsure about any Gerbil API, symbol name, module export, function arity, or macro behavior, use the appropriate MCP tool to check before writing code. This is not optional — it is required practice for all Gerbil work in this repository.
